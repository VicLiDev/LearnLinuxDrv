tips:
1. bus addr maybe equal to physical address, if don't have iommu
2. Kernel logical address maps a portion (perhaps all) of hardware memory,
   usually treated as a physical address. On most architectures,
   logical addresses differ from their associated physical addresses
   by only a fixed offset.
3. Low memory: memory at logical address in kernel space
   High memory: Memory with no logical address because it is outside
                the address range reserved for kernel virtual addresses
